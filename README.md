# Sales_Data_Analysis-with-python
Based on the code you provided, it seems you are working on a project involving analyzing sales data from an Excel file named 'Orders.xlsx'. Here's a breakdown of what you've done so far:

Data Loading and Inspection: You loaded the data from the Excel file into a Pandas DataFrame and inspected the first few rows using df.head() and df.head(19), and the last few rows using df.tail() to get an overview of the data structure.

Data Exploration: You checked the shape of the DataFrame using df.shape, examined the columns using df.columns, and inspected data types and non-null counts using df.info(). You also checked for missing values using df.isnull().sum() and calculated summary statistics using df.describe().

Date Range Analysis: You extracted information about the date range of the orders, finding the earliest and latest order dates using df['Order_Date'].min() and df['Order_Date'].max(), respectively. You also created a new column month_year to group orders by month and year.

Time Series Analysis: You performed time series analysis by grouping orders by date using df.groupby('Order_Date').sum()['Order_ID'] and visualized the trend using Matplotlib.

Product Analysis: You grouped orders by product SKU using df.groupby('Product_SKU').sum()['Order_ID'] to analyze sales by product.

Overall, it seems like you're exploring sales data, analyzing trends over time, and investigating sales performance by product. This project likely aims to gain insights into sales patterns, identify top-selling products, and possibly make recommendations for optimizing sales strategies.
